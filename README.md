# Neighborhood React Map ft. Boston Restaurants

An fully accessible interactive map of Boston featuring 5 great restaurant recommendations. Users can click on the markers to see some information about the restaurants as well as open up the sidebar menu to see more information sourced from Yelp's API. The sidebar contains a filter feature to sort through the restaurants by name. This interactive map is my way of sharing my favorite restaurants with you all.
